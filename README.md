This debouncer repo contains the Verilog code for:

1. [Debouncing buttons](http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html)

2. [Measuring the number of times a button bounces, and how long it takes to settle](http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/05/bounce-metric.html), and

3. All of these are tied together using a [wishbone scope](https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope) approach to measuring the result of any bounces.

It is a companion distribution to the button bouncing article series found on [zipcpu.com](http://zipcpu.com)
